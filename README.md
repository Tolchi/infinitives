# Greek New Testament Infinitives

by [J.K.Tauber](http://jktauber.com)

`infinitives.txt` contains the present and aorist infinitive forms of verbs in the Greek New Testament.

`.actual` refers to forms occurring in the SBLGNT.

`.generated` refers to forms generated based on stems and rules being developed for my Morphological Lexicon of the Greek New Testament.


## Caveats

  * forms may be generated for voices which are impossible or which never appear in texts;
  * there may be widespread systematic errors as this initial assembly of data was done fairly quickly from sources in quite a different format.

If you find errors, please file an issue here and I'll try to fix the upstream database and generate a new `infinitives.txt` as soon as possible.
